# Smily-University
This is a university administration system using NodeJS, JavaScript, and SQL. Admins can create, edit, view, or delete information about teachers and students in the database. Teachers can only update students' grades. The login system determines if the user is an admin or a teacher. This SQL database is integrated with AWS RDS.
